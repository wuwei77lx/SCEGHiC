# SCEG-HiC(predicting single-cell enhancer gene interactions by integrating prior Hi-C information)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
## Overview
SCEG-HiC predicts interactions between genes and enhancers using multi-ome (paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq or only scATAC-seq) 
sequencing data and three-dimensional omics data (the bulk average Hi-C). The approach uses weighted graphical lasso (wlasso) model, 
taking the average Hi-C data as prior knowledge, to predict cell specific interactions between genes and enhancers based on the 
correlation between genes and enhancers.

## Installation

### Required software

SCEG-HiC runs in the [R statistical computing environment](https://www.r-project.org/). You will need R version 4.1.0 or higher, [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) version 3.14 or higher, and Seurat 4.0 or higher to have access to the latest features.

To install Bioconductor, open R and run:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
```

Next, install a few Bioconductor dependencies that aren't automatically installed:

``` r
BiocManager::install(c('BiocGenerics', 'DelayedArray', 'DelayedMatrixStats',
                       'limma', 'lme4', 'S4Vectors', 'SingleCellExperiment',
                       'SummarizedExperiment', 'batchelor', 'HDF5Array',
                       'terra', 'ggrastr','Gviz', 'rtracklayer','GenomeInfoDb','GenomicRanges'))
```

Installation of other dependencies

- Install Signac pacakge : ```devtools::install_github("timoast/signac", ref = "develop")```. Please check [here](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/install.html#development-version-1) if you encounter any issue.
- Install Cicero package: ```devtools::install_github("cole-trapnell-lab/cicero-release", ref = "monocle3")```. Please check [here](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/docs_m3/#installing-cicero) if you encounter any issue.

Now, you can install the development version of SCEG-HiC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wuwei77lx/SCEGHiC")
```

If you wish to install CRAN of SCEG-HiC, execute:

```r
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("SCEGHiC")
```
### Testing the installation

To ensure that SCEG-HiC was installed correctly, start a new R session and run:

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(SCEGHiC)
```

## The bulk average Hi-C
The celltypes used by human for averaging are: GM12878, NHEK, HMEC, RPE1, THP1, IMR90, HUVEC, HCT116, K562, KBM7. 
The celltypes used by mouse for averaging are: mESC1, mESC2, CH12LX, CH12F3, fiber, epithelium, B

Generate the bulk average Hi-C using the [Activity by Contact (ABC)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0538-0) model's \code{"makeAverageHiC.py"}

Average Hi-C data can be downloaded from: 
## Quickstart

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

Aggregated with paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data
```{r example1}
library(SCEGHiC)
library(Signac)
## basic example code
data(multiomic_small)

# Preprocess data
SCEGdata <- process_data(multiomic_small, k_neigh = 5, max_overlap = 0.5)

gene <- c("TRABD2A", "GNLY", "MFSD6", "CTLA4", "LCLAT1", "NCK2", "GALM", "TMSB10", "ID2", "CXCR4")
fpath <- system.file("extdata", package = "SCEGHiC")

# Calculate weight
weight <- calculateHiCWeights(SCEGdata, species = "Homo sapiens", genome = "hg38", focus_gene = gene, averHicPath = fpath)

# Run model
results_SCEGHiC <- Run_SCEG_HiC(SCEGdata, weight, focus_gene = gene)

# Visualize the links
connections_Plot(results_SCEGHiC, species = "Homo sapiens", genome = "hg38", focus_gene = "CTLA4", cutoff = 0.01, gene_anno = NULL)

# Coverage plot and visualize the links of CTLA4
fpath <- system.file("extdata", "multiomic_small_atac_fragments.tsv.gz", package = "SCEGHiC")
frags <- CreateFragmentObject(path = fpath, cells = colnames(multiomic_small))
Fragments(multiomic_small) <- frags
coverPlot(multiomic_small, focus_gene = "CTLA4", species = "Homo sapiens", genome = "hg38", assay = "peaks", SCEG_HiC_Result = results_SCEGHiC, SCEG_HiC_cutoff = 0.01)
```
