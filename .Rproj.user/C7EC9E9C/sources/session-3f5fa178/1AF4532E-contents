# SCEG-HiC(predicting single-cell enhancer gene interactions by integrating prior Hi-C information)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
## Overview
SCEG-HiC predicts interactions between genes and enhancers using multi-ome (paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq or only scATAC-seq) 
sequencing data and three-dimensional omics data (the bulk average Hi-C). The approach uses weighted graphical lasso (wlasso) model, 
taking the average Hi-C data as prior knowledge, to predict cell specific interactions between genes and enhancers based on the 
correlation between genes and enhancers.

## Installation

### Required software

SCEG-HiC runs in the [R statistical computing environment](https://www.r-project.org/). You will need R version 4.1.0 or higher, [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) version 3.14 or higher, and Seurat 4.0 or higher to have access to the latest features.

To install Bioconductor, open R and run:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
```

Next, install a few Bioconductor dependencies that aren't automatically installed:

``` r
BiocManager::install(c('BiocGenerics', 'DelayedArray', 'DelayedMatrixStats',
                       'limma', 'lme4', 'S4Vectors', 'SingleCellExperiment',
                       'SummarizedExperiment', 'batchelor', 'HDF5Array',
                       'terra', 'ggrastr','Gviz', 'rtracklayer','GenomeInfoDb','GenomicRanges'))
```

Installation of other dependencies

- Install Signac pacakge : ```devtools::install_github("timoast/signac", ref = "develop")```. Please check [here](https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/install.html#development-version-1) if you encounter any issue.
- Install Cicero package: ```devtools::install_github("cole-trapnell-lab/cicero-release", ref = "monocle3")```. Please check [here](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cicero-release/docs_m3/#installing-cicero) if you encounter any issue.

Now, you can install the development version of SCEG-HiC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wuwei77lx/SCEGHiC")
```

If you wish to install CRAN of SCEG-HiC, execute:

```r
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("SCEGHiC")
```
### Testing the installation

To ensure that SCEG-HiC was installed correctly, start a new R session and run:

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(SCEGHiC)
```

## Quickstart

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SCEGHiC)
## basic example code
```

See [documentation website](https://github.com/wuwei77lx/SCEGHiC/) for more information!
