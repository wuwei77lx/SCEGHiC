\usage{
connections_Plot(
  SCEG_HiC_Result,
  species,
  genome,
  focus_gene,
  cutoff = NULL,
  upstream = 250000,
  downstream = 250000,
  gene_anno = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SCEG_HiC_Result}{SCEG-HiC result.}

\item{species}{String, indicating the name of the species.It can be either "Homo sapiens" or "Mus musculus".}

\item{genome}{String, indicating the name of the genome assembly.It can be either "hg38",
"hg19", "mm10", or "mm9".}

\item{focus_gene}{The focused a gene.}

\item{cutoff}{The threshold of gene-peak.Default is NULL.If \code{"aggregate"} is TRUE ,we recommend the cutoff of 0.01.
If \code{"aggregate"} is FALSE ,we recommend the cutoff of 0.001.}

\item{upstream}{Numeric specifying the window size (in base pairs) to pad around upstream of each TSS, to fetch gene's enhancers.
Default is 250 kb (so 500 kb window is drawn around each TSS).}

\item{downstream}{Numeric specifying the window size (in base pairs) to pad around downstream of each TSS, to fetch gene's enhancers.
Default is 250 kb (so 500 kb window is drawn around each TSS).}

\item{gene_anno}{Either \code{NULL} or a data.frame. The data.frame should be in a form compatible with the Gviz function.
\code{\link[Gviz]{GeneRegionTrack-class}} (cannot have NA as column names).}
}
\value{
A gene region and gene-peak pairs plot.
