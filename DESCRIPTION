Title: Predicting Single-cell Enhancer Gene Interactions by Integrating Prior Hi-C Information
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: SCEG-HiC predicts interactions between genes and enhancers using multi-ome (paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq or only scATAC-seq) 
     sequencing data and three-dimensional omics data (the bulk average Hi-C). The approach uses weighted graphical lasso (wlasso) model, 
     taking the average Hi-C data as prior knowledge, to predict cell specific interactions between genes and enhancers based on the 
     correlation between genes and enhancers.
